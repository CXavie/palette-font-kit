✨ Aesthetic Generator — Master Theory
A high-fidelity, interactive Design System Generator built to bridge the gap between color theory and modern UI development. This tool allows users to generate balanced color palettes based on mathematical harmonies and preview them in a real-time card component.

🚀 Key Functionality
Hue-Locked Color Engine: Prevents the common "RGB jump" where lowering saturation to monochromatic levels resets the color picker to Red. The hue is preserved mathematically.

Mathematical Harmonies: Switch between different color relationship models:

Analogous: Colors adjacent on the wheel for a serene, comfortable design.

Monochrome: Varying tones and tints of a single hue for a clean, unified look.

Complementary: High-contrast pairings from opposite sides of the wheel.

Triadic: Three colors evenly spaced for vibrant, balanced diversity.

Accessibility First: Features a real-time WCAG Contrast Ratio calculator that checks the Primary color against the background and provides a visual "Pass/Fail" badge.

Typography Playground: Includes a curated selection of Google Fonts (Modern Sans, Elegant Serif, and Monospace) to test how colors interact with different typefaces.

Style Persistence: A built-in "Favorites" sidebar using localStorage so you can save and revisit palettes without needing a database.

Dark Mode Aware: Fully responsive UI that supports a dedicated Dark Mode toggle to see how your colors perform on deep backgrounds.

🎨 Purpose
The purpose of this site is to eliminate the guesswork in UI design. It is specifically built for:

Developers who need a quick, aesthetically pleasing palette that is mathematically "correct."

Designers looking to test accessibility (Contrast Ratios) before moving into production.

Prototypers who need a design system they can export immediately as JSON.

🛠️ Usage
Choose your Base: Use the color picker to select your starting point.

Set the Harmony: Use the dropdown to select a theory (e.g., Triadic).

Refine Typography: Select a font to see how the weight and style impact the color's legibility.

Save/Export: Click "Save Favorite" to store the style in your sidebar, or "Export JSON" to get the raw color data for your code.
